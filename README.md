# ðŸ©º PVT-MiniUNet: Lightweight Transformer for Colon Polyp Segmentation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Detecting **colon polyps** early during colonoscopy is crucial for prevention, but automatic segmentation is difficult due to:

* High variability in polyp size, shape, and texture
* Low contrast with surrounding tissue
* Motion blur, lighting issues, and specular highlights


## ðŸš€ Key Contributions

* **Pyramid Vision Transformer v2 (PVTv2-B2) Encoder**
  Captures **multi-scale global and local features** efficiently.

* **Mini-UNet Decoder (replacing SAM)**
  Recovers **fine spatial details** with lower complexity.
  â†’ Improves polyp boundary segmentation.

* **Camouflage Identification Module (CIM)**
  Highlights **subtle boundaries** where polyps blend with surrounding tissue.

* **Cascaded Fusion Module (CFM)**
  Merges multi-scale features for better context understanding.



## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

1. Input colonoscopy image passed through **PVTv2 Encoder** â†’ extracts hierarchical features.
2. **CFM** integrates deep semantic features across scales.
3. **CIM** enhances boundary visibility and fine details.
4. **Mini-UNet Decoder** combines CFM + CIM outputs â†’ reconstructs accurate segmentation mask.
5. Output: **Binary polyp mask** aligned with input image.
